11. Select the **General** channel below the **IT-Department** teams.

12. Close the Teams Desktop client.

You have successfully created a new team with the Teams Desktop client, by using an existing Microsoft 365 Group. Leave the Teams client open and continue with the next task.

#### Task 2 - Create a team by using PowerShell

In this task you will create via the Teams PowerShell a new team **"CA-Office"**. You will create the public channels **"Support"** and **"Recruiting"**. Additionally, you will create the private channel **"Administration"** via Teams PowerShell.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, right click the **Start** button and then select **Windows PowerShell**.

3. Run the following cmdlet to connect to Microsoft Teams in your tenant:

   ```powershell
   Connect-MicrosoftTeams
   ```

4. A **Sign in** dialog box will open. Enter the **UPN** of **Joni Sherman‚Äôs** O365 Credentials provided to you (for example, JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com) and then select **Next**.

5. In the **Enter password** dialog box, enter the **password** of **Joni Sherman‚Äôs** O365 Credentials provided to you and then select **Sign in**.

6. Type the following cmdlet to the PowerShell window to create the new team **CA-Office**:

    ```powershell
    New-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" -MailNickName "CA-Office" -Visibility Public
    ```

7. To add the user **Alex Wilber** to the team type the following cmdlet (Replacing **&lt;YourTenant&gt;** with the name of the Microsoft 365 Tenant provided to you.):

    ```powershell
    Get-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" | Add-TeamUser -User AlexW@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

    ```powershell
    Get-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" | Add-TeamUser -User AllanD@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

9. Create a channel **Support** in the **CA-Office** team by using the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Get-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" | New-TeamChannel -DisplayName "Support"
    ```

10. Create another channel **Recruiting** in the **CA-Office** team by using the following cmdlet:
